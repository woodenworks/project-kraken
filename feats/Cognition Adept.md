## Cognition Adept
*Prerequisite:*

You have learned enough about dreamwalking to tap into the Dream and grant yourself the following:
- You gain 2 connection points which you can use for dreamwalker features. If you have at least one level in dreamwalker, these recharge as normal; otherwise, you regain these points when you complete a short or long rest.
- You learn the *Enhanced Reverie* feature from the dreamwalker class. Unless you already know the _reverie_ cantrip from another source, you may only cast it while also expending a connection point. Your spellcasting ability for _reverie_ is Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma (choose when you select this feat).
- You learn one Disjunctive Cognition from the dreamwalker class. If the cognition has a prerequisite of any kind, you can choose that cognition only if you're a dreamwalker who meets the prerequisites. Whenever you gain a level, you can replace the cognition with another one from the dreamwalker class.
