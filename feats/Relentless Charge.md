## Relentless Charge
*Prerequisite: Centaur*

You have extensively practiced your charge attacks and gain the following benefits:
- Increase your Strength or Dexterity by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- When you deal damage with your Charge feature, use 1d8 instead of 1d6 for every 10 feet moved.
- When you deal damage with your Charge feature, your movement doesnâ€™t provoke opportunity attacks for the rest of the turn, unless your opponent has the Sentinel feat.
