## Shieldlelagh
*Prerequisite: Cleric, Dreamwalker, or Druid*

You gain proficiency in shields. If you already have proficiency from another source, shields grant an additional +1 to AC for you.

As a bonus action, you can imbue your shield with the fey magic of the Dream. In addition to its AC bonus, the shield becomes a weapon you are proficient with. When used in this way, it deals 1d8 bludgeoning damage, plus you can use your Wisdom instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls. Additionally, it is treated as a magical weapon.
