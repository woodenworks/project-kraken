***Angelic Retreat.*** If the Silent Guardian reaches 0 hit points while outside of Heaven, she does not die. Rather, she disappears in a flash of light and reforms in her citadel.

***Quick Reflexes.*** The Silent Guardian has two reactions on each turn.

***Sentinel.*** Creatures provoke opportunity attacks from the Silent Guardian even if they take the Disengage action before leaving her reach. When she hits a creature with an opportunity attack, its speed drops to 0 for the rest of the turn.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The Silent Guardian makes two longsword attacks and one sacred flame attack.

***Flame Tongue Longsword.*** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 10 (1d8 + 6) slashing damage, plus 7 (2d6) fire damage.

***Sacred Flame.*** _Ranged Spell:_ one target, range 60 ft. The target must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or take 18 (4d8) radiant damage.

***Spellcasting.*** The Silent Guardian casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 18):
- At will: _alter self_ (can become a Medium humanoid when changing her appearance), _command, comprehend languages_
- 3/day each: _fireball, hideous laughter, plane shift_
- 1/day each: _bestow curse_ (as a 7th-level spell), _dominate person_

### Bonus Actions
***Divine Smite.*** The Silent Guardian adds 22 (4d10) radiant damage to her next melee weapon attack.

***Scorching Smite.*** The Silent Guardian adds 14 (4d6) fire damage to her next melee weapon attack. The target must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or become vulnerable to fire damage for one minute. (Creatures immune to fire damage automatically succeed on this saving throw.)

### Reactions
***Opportunity Attack.*** The Silent Guardian can make a melee weapon attack whenever a creature enters or leaves her melee attack range, or when a creature within 5 feet of her makes an attack against a target other than her (and that target doesn't have the Sentinel feat). 

### Legendary Actions
The Silent Guardian can take 2 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. She regains spent legendary actions at the start of her turn.

***Fly.*** The Silent Guardian disengages and flies up to half her flying speed.

***Sacred Flame.*** The Silent Guardian makes one Sacred Flame attack.

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the silent guardian can use the following lair action.

- ***Summon Reinforcements.*** The **Voice of the Guardian** appears within 120 feet of the Silent Guardian. If it is already present, instead roll a d6 and add the following to unoccupied space(s) within range. The summoned creatures are loyal to both Aradon and the Silent Guardian. When the Silent Guardian reaches 0 hit points, all summoned skeletons and couatls vanish.

|d6|Summon|

### Info  
The Silent Guardian is a particularly powerful celestial who leads a battalion of Devas. Her agents are frequently seen in the Material plane working to aid the Aradonian Empire, defying millenia of tradition. When she is not disguising her true celestial appearance, she has the lower body of a feathered serpent and the upper torso of a humanoid female, with two pairs of feathered wings spreading behind her. She frequently appears instead in her mortal form. Regardless of the shape she takes, she always wears a mask.

The Silent Guardian is so named because she keeps her identity hidden behind a mask and seldom speaks except through a representative. In life, the Silent Guardian was Emperor Evelina, progenitor of the modern incarnation of the Aradonian Empire following the Rupture, and mother of the current Emperor, Mirenamor. Her force of personality was such that she persisted after death and has worked to bolster Aradon at every turn, although she does so in secret to avoid undermining her son's authority. A handful of powerful arcanists, clerics, and scholars know her identity, but do not widely share this information for fear of earning her ire.
