The Silent Guardian is a particularly powerful celestial who leads a battalion of Devas. Her agents are frequently seen in the Material plane working to aid the Aradonian Empire, defying millenia of tradition.

The Silent Guardian is so named because she keeps her identity hidden behind a mask and seldom speaks except through a representative. In life, the Silent Guardian was Emperor Evelina, progenitor of the modern incarnation of the Aradonian Empire following the Rupture, and mother of the current Emperor, Mirenamor. Her force of personality was such that she persisted after death and has worked to bolster Aradon at every turn, although she does so in secret to avoid undermining her son's authority.
