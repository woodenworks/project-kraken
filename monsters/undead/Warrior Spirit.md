### Traits

***Turn Exclusion.*** The Spirit will not be affected when a friendly creature uses a feature to turn undead.

***Laid to Rest.*** The Spirit has manifested temporarily. It cannot regain any lost Hit Points, and no effect can force it to remain when its time expires.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The Spirit uses Magnetic Pull (if available), then makes 2 Greatsword attacks or uses Righteous Punishment.

***Greatsword.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* Bonus equals your spell attack modifier, reach 5 ft. *Hit* 12 (2d6 + 5) Force damage. Until the start of the spirit's next turn, the target has disadvantage on any attack roll that isn’t against the spirit, and when the target hits a creature other than the spirit with an attack, that creature has resistance to the damage dealt by the attack. A creature immune to being Charmed is not affected by this trait.

***Righteous Punishment.*** *Constitution Saving Throw:* DC equals your spell save DC, each creature within 10 feet of the Spirit. _Failure:_ 4d6 thunder damage and is Deafened until the start of its next turn.

***Magnetic Pull (Recharge 5–6).*** _Strength or Dexterity Saving Throw:_ DC equals your spell save DC, any creature within 30 ft. wearing metal armor or holding a metal item (made with advantage if it is an attuned magical item). _Failure:_ Creatures wearing metal armor are pulled up to 30 feet in a straight line toward the spirit. A creature holding a metal item(s) lose hold of the item(s), which is pulled up to 30 feet in a straight line toward the Spirit.

***Spellcasting.*** The Spirit casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using your spellcasting modifier and spell save DC:
- At will: _Crusader's Mantle, Spiritual Weapon_
- 1/day: _Fire Shield_
