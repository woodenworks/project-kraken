### Traits
***Turn Exclusion.*** The Spirit will not be affected when a friendly creature uses a feature to turn undead.

***Daylight.*** The Spirit permanently emits light, as if by the spell _daylight_.

***Explosive Return.*** When the Spirit reaches 0 hit points, it explodes. All creatures within 30 feet of the Spirit must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d6 fire damage + 5d6 radiant damage on a failure, or half as much damage on a success. Allies of the Spirit are unaffected.

***Laid to Rest.*** The Spirit has manifested temporarily. It cannot regain any lost Hit Points, and no effect can force it to remain when its time expires.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The Spirit makes 2 Burning Blade attacks. It can replace 1 of them with Radiant Burst.

***Burning Blade.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* Bonus equals your spell attack modifier, reach 10 ft. *Hit* 8 (2d6 + 5) Fire damage.

***Radiant Burst.*** *Dexterity Saving Throw:* DC equals your spell save DC, one creature the Spirit can see within 30 feet of itself. _Failure:_ The target takes 4d6 radiant damage and is blinded until the start of its next turn.

***Reveal Illusion (Recharge 5–6).*** The Spirit emits a pulse with a radius of 30 feet. Any illusion spell of 3rd level or below is dispelled. Invisible creatures must make a saving throw against your Spell Save DC, becoming visible on a failure.

***Spellcasting.*** The Spirit casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using your spellcasting modifier and Spell Save DC:<br>
- At will: _dancing lights (does not require concentration)_<br>
