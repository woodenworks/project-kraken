### Traits
***Turn Exclusion.*** The Spirit will not be affected when a friendly creature uses a feature to turn Undead.

***Liquid Shadows.*** The Spirit is Heavily Obscured. All attacks against the Spirit are made with Disadvantage.

***Flickering Strike.*** The Spirit can teleport up to 3 times on its turn to a space it can see (no action required), provided that it never travels more than 50 feet from where it started its turn.

***Laid to Rest.*** The Spirit has manifested temporarily. It cannot regain any lost Hit Points, and no effect can force it to remain when its time expires.

### Actions
***Phantom Blade.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* Bonus equals your spell attack modifier, reach 5 ft. *Hit* 10 (2d4 + 5) Force damage. _Sneak Attack:_ If the attack was made with advantage, or if an ally who is not incapacitated is within 5 feet of the target, deal an additional 35 (10d6) Force damage.

***Muddled Identity (1/day).*** Everything within 30 feet of the Spirit goes completely dark for a moment. When the darkness fades, an illusion covers any number of creatures, making each one appear to be a different creature in range. The Spirit, and any creatures it designates, can see through this illusion. The illusion vanishes on an affected creature after 1 round or as soon as it takes damage.

***Spellcasting.*** The Spirit casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using your spellcasting modifier and Spell Save DC:
- 1/day each: _confusion, hypnotic pattern, knock_

### Bonus Action
The Spirit can take 2 Bonus Actions on each of its turns.

***Duplicity.*** The Spirit leaves behind a duplicate of itself the next time it teleports, as per the Ancestor’s Trickery option in your Aligned Ancestry feature. The Spirit can have up to 3 active duplicates at a time.

***Cunning Action.*** The Spirit uses the Hide action.

### Reaction
***Riposte.*** When one of the Spirit's duplicates is attacked with a melee attack, it makes a Phantom Blade attack against its opponent before it disappears.
