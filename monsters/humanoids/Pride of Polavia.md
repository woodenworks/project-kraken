***Mining Rig.*** The Pride of Polavia can only move or act while driven by a small creature. While inside, the creature is restrained, has total cover, and takes its turns as the Pride of Polavia.

***Floodlights.*** The Pride of Polavia emits bright light in a 30ft. cone in front of it, and dim light for 30ft. beyond that.

***Filtered Intake.*** The Pride of Polavia has advantage on saving throws made to resist effects that are gaseous in origin.


### Actions
***Drill Arm.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5ft., one target. *Hit* (3d6 + 4) piercing damage. If the target is made of inorganic material such as stone, crystal, or metal, this damage is always critical.

***Claw Arm.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5ft., one target. *Hit* (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it is grappled (escape DC 16). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained and the Pride of Polavia can't use its claw on another target.
