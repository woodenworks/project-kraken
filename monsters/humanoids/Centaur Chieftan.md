***Relentless Charge.*** If the centaur moves at least 10 feet in a straight line toward a target and then hits it with a melee weapon attack on the same turn, the attack deals an extra 4 (1d8) damage for every 10 feet moved. If the centaur damages a creature with this trait, they will not provoke attacks of opportunity until the end of their turn.

### Actions
***Pike.*** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 9 (1d10 + 4) piercing damage.

***Hooves.*** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 7 (1d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage.

***Longbow.*** _Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, range 150/600 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 6 (1d8 + 2) piercing damage.

### Bonus Actions
***Commanding Strike.*** When the Centaur Chieftan hits with a melee attack against a target, they may use their bonus action and select a friendly Creature within five feet of the target. That Creature can immediately use its reaction to make a weapon attack against the same target.
