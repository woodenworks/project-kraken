***Relentless Charge.*** If the centaur moves at least 10 feet in a straight line toward a target and then makes a melee weapon attack, the first hit against the target deals an extra 4 (1d8) damage for every 10 feet moved. If the centaur damages a creature with this trait, it will not provoke attacks of opportunity until the end of its turn.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The chieftan makes two weapon attacks; it can use either its pike or longbow, but not both.

***Pike.*** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 9 (1d10 + 4) piercing damage.

***Hooves.*** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 7 (1d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage.

***Longbow.*** _Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, range 150/600 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 6 (1d8 + 2) piercing damage.

### Bonus Actions
***Commanding Strike.*** The chieftan targets one ally it can see within 50 ft. If the target can see and hear the chieftan, the target can make one weapon attack as a reaction against a creature that the chieftan has attacked on this turn.
