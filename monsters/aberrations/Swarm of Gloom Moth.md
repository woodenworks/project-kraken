***Swarm.*** The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny moth. The swarm can't regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.

***Pack Tactics.*** These guys work together like peanut butter and jelly.

***Fowl Appearance.*** While the creature remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a normal chicken.

***Hangriness.*** This creature is angry, and hungry. It will refuse to do anything with you until its hunger is satisfied.
