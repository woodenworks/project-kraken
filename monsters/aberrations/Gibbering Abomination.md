***Aberrant Ground.*** When initiative is rolled, surfaces in a 30-foot radius around the abomination becomes doughlike difficult terrain; this effect spreads in a radius on the floor and ceiling, and climbs walls. Each creature that starts its turn in that area must succeed on a DC 10 Strength saving throw or have its speed reduced to 0 until the start of its next turn.

***Pack Tactics.*** These guys work together like peanut butter and jelly.

***Fowl Appearance.*** While the creature remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a normal chicken.

***Hangriness.*** This creature is angry, and hungry. It will refuse to do anything with you until its hunger is satisfied.
