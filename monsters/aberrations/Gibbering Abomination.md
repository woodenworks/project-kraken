___
***Aberrant Ground.*** When initiative is rolled, all surfaces within the room (up to a 100-foot radius around the Abomination) become doughlike difficult terrain; this includes the floor, ceiling, and walls, but does not spread outside of the room where the Abomination is anchored. Each creature that starts its turn in this area must succeed on a DC 10 Strength saving throw or have its speed reduced to 0 until the start of its next turn.

***Immutable Form.*** The Gibbering Abomination is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.

***Anchored.*** The Gibbering Abomination is anchored to the floor and ceiling. It cannot be moved and automatically fails Dexterity saving throws. If the ceiling above it is destroyed, such as with a _disintegrate_ spell or when damaged by a creature with the Siege Monster trait, the Abomination collapses and loses its Aberrant Ground trait and Flab reaction.

### Actions
{{***Lorem.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5ft., one target. *Hit* 5 (1d6 + 2) }}

### Bonus Actions
***Command Nutrition.*** The Gibbering Abomination beckons a Gibbering Mouther or Mouthling that it can see. If the target has enough movement speed, it uses its reaction to move to the Abomination. The Abomination absorbs the target, destroying it, and regains hit points equal to the hit points of the target (maximum of 50).

### Reactions
***Flab.*** When a creature damages the Abomination using a melee weapon attack that deals piercing or slashing damage, the Abomination can use its reaction and attempt to trap the weapon within its flesh. The attacking creature must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw; on a failure, the weapon is stuck until a creature uses an action to wrench the weapon free. (As long as the weapon's owner remains within 5 feet of it, enemy creatures cannot attempt to retrieve the weapon.)

### Legendary Actions
The Gibbering Abomination can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. Creature regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

***Spawn Mouthling.*** The Abomination loses 5 hit points, and a **Mouthling*** with 5 hit points appears in an unoccupied space affected by Abberant Ground that the Abomination can see. 

***Gnashing Teeth.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, one target standing on Aberrant Ground. *Hit* 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage. On a critical hit, the Abomination regains hit points equal to the damage dealt.

### Lair Actions
The unnatural magic of the Gibbering Abomination allows it to take lair actions. If there are multiple Abominations in the same lair, only one lair action is taken, but saving throws to avoid its effects are made with disadvantage. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the Abomination takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:

***No Escape.*** If the Abomination's Abberant Ground trait is affecting any walls with openings, such as doorways or windows, fleshy membranes seal them shut. These membranes have AC 12 and 30 hit points each

***Discordant Gibbering.*** The Abomination babbles incoherently, a deep and discordant symphony of gibberish. Any creature within the lair who can hear it must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the creature suffers paranoid hallucinations and {{effect}}

### Info
The Gibbering Abomination is the foulest member of the Gibbering Horde. Formed by the fusion of several Mouthers, the Abomination acts as a hive queen, linking together the minds of Gibbering Mouthers, Mouthlings, and other lesser Aberrations in the vicinity. Nefarious warlocks and foul sorcerers will sometimes use their magic to jumpstart this process, literally stitching Mouthers together in a dark ritual.

Immobile—but always hungry—the Abomination will direct Mouthers and Mouthlings to retrieve prey that can feed its appetite.
