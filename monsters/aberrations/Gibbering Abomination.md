### Traits

***Aberrant Ground.*** All surfaces within the room (up to a 100-foot radius around the abomination) become doughlike Difficult Terrain; this includes the floor, ceiling, and walls, but does not spread outside of the room where the abomination is anchored. The abomination's Tremorsense extends across the affected area. Each creature that starts its turn in this area must succeed on a DC 10 Strength saving throw or have its Speed reduced to 0 until the start of its next turn.

***Immutable Form.*** The gibbering abomination is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.

***Anchored.*** The gibbering abomination is anchored to the floor and ceiling. It cannot be moved and automatically fails Dexterity saving throws. If the ceiling above it is destroyed, such as with a _Disintegrate_ spell or when damaged by a creature with the Siege Monster trait, the abomination collapses and loses its Aberrant Ground trait and Flab reaction.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The gibbering abomination makes one bite attack and, if it can, uses its Blinding Spittle.

***Bite.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +8, reach 5 ft. *Hit*  17 (5d6) Piercing damage. If the target is killed by this damage, it is absorbed into the abomination which regains 20 HP and its use of Blinding Spittle.

***Blinding Spittle (1/day).*** _Dexterity Saving Throw:_ DC 14. The abomination spits a chemical glob at a point it can see within 30 feet of it, which explodes in a blinding flash of light in a 5-foot radius. _Failure:_ The target has the Blinded condition until the end of the abomination's next turn.

***Eldritch Word (Recharge 5-6).*** All of the abomination's voices coalesce into a single word of Deep Speech. _Wisdom Saving Throw:_ DC 14, all creatures who can hear the abomination (made with advantage if the creature is not touching Aberrant Ground; Aberrations are immune). _Failure:_ The target joins the babbling chorus and becomes unable to speak or use Verbal components for 10 minutes. At the end of each of its turns, the target repeats the save, ending the effect on itself on a success.

### Bonus Actions

***Command Nutrition.*** The gibbering abomination beckons a **gibbering mouther (MM)** or **mouthling*** that it can see. The target uses its Reaction to move up to its Speed toward the abomination. If it ends its movement within 5 feet of the abomination, the abomination absorbs the target, destroying it, and regains HP equal to the HP of the target (maximum of 50). Additionally, the abomination regains its use of Blinding Spittle.

### Reactions

***Flab.*** _Trigger:_ A creature damages the abomination using a melee weapon attack that deals Piercing or Slashing damage. _Response:_ The abomination attempts to trap the weapon within its flesh. The attacking creature must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw; on a failure, the weapon is stuck until a creature uses a Utilize Action to wrench the weapon free. (As long as the weapon's owner remains within 5 feet of it, its enemies cannot attempt to retrieve the weapon.)

### Legendary Actions
The gibbering abomination can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. The abomination regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

***Spawn Mouthling.*** The abomination loses 5 HP, and a **mouthling*** with 5 HP appears in an unoccupied space affected by Abberant Ground that the abomination can see. 

***Spawn Mouther.*** The abomination loses 50 HP, and a **gibbering mouther (MM)** with 50 HP appears in an unoccupied space affected by Abberant Ground that the abomination can see. 

***Gnashing Teeth.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +8, one target standing on Aberrant Ground. *Hit*  10 (1d10 + 5) Piercing damage. On a Critical Hit, the abomination regains HP equal to the damage dealt.

### Lair Actions
The unnatural magic of the gibbering abomination allows it to take lair actions. If there are multiple abominations in the same lair, only one lair action is taken, but saving throws to avoid its effects are made with disadvantage. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the abomination takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:

***No Escape (1/day).*** If the abomination's Abberant Ground trait is affecting any walls with openings, such as doorways or windows, fleshy membranes seal them shut. These membranes have AC 12, 30 HP each, and Vulnerability to Slashing and Cold damage.

***Discordant Gibbering.*** The abomination babbles incoherently, a deep and discordant symphony of gibberish. _Wisdom Saving Throw:_ DC 14, all creatures who can hear the abomination (made with advantage if the creature is not touching Aberrant Ground; Aberrations are immune). _Failure:_ 1d4 Psychic damage for each consecutive turn it failed this save.

### Info
The gibbering abomination is the foulest member of the gibbering horde. Formed by the fusion of several mouthers, the abomination acts as a hive queen, linking together the minds of gibbering mouthers, mouthlings, and other lesser Aberrations in the vicinity. Three gibbering mouthers can merge to form a gibbering abomination, a process which takes 24 hours. Nefarious warlocks and foul sorcerers will sometimes use their magic to jumpstart this process, literally stitching mouthers together in a dark ritual.

Immobile—but always hungry—the abomination will spawn mouthers and mouthlings to hunt, then reabsorb them to feed its appetite.
