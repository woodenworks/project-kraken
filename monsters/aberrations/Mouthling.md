### Traits

***Arterial Transport.*** The Mouthling has a burrow speed of 80 feet, which can only be used on contiguous areas of Aberrant Ground.

***Gibbering Horde.*** The Mouthling is immune to Gibbering (and similar abilities) from non-hostile Aberrations.

### Actions
***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +2 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 4 (1d4)+2 piercing damage. The Mouthling regains hit points equal to half the damage done (minimum 1).

***Gibber.*** The mouthling babbles incoherently. Each creature within 10 feet of the mouthling that can hear the gibbering must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the creature can’t take reactions until the start of its next turn and makes its next attack with disadvantage. Aberrations are immune to this effect.
