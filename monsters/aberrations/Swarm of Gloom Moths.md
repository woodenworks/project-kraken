___
***Encompassing Swarm.*** The swarm consists of thousands of individual creatures and can occupy space as large as a 50 ft. sphere. The swarm can condense to occupy a smaller area, can occupy other creatures' spaces, and can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny moth (although passing through any opening smaller than 5 ft. in any dimension is considered difficult terrain). The swarm can't regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.

***Razorswarm.*** When a creature starts its turn inside the swarm, it suffers 1d4+2 slashing damage.

***Shapes in the Dark.*** While in darkness, the swarm gains advantage on Stealth (Dexterity) checks. Any time the swarm damages a creature that is in darkness, it deals an extra 1d4 psychic damage.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The swarm makes one Slicing Wings attack for every 30 Hit Points it has (rounded up), each against a different target within its area. It also uses its {placeholder action} if available.

***Whirling Wings.*** A creature within the swarm must succeed on a DC 14 Charisma Saving Throw or suffer a Hallucination from the table below:

***Slicing Wings.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +3 to hit, reach 5ft., one target. *Hit* 5 (1d6 + 2) 

### Bonus Actions
***Smothering Gloom.*** The swarm extinguishes each source of light inside it, except for open flames or light sources created with a spell slot of third level or higher.

### Reactions
***{{hate the light}}.*** When a creature creates a light source on its space within the swarm, the swarm may make a Slicing Wings attack against that creature.
