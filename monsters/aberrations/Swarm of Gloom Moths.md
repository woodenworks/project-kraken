___
***Encompassing Swarm.*** The swarm consists of thousands of individual creatures and can occupy space as large as a 50 ft. sphere. The swarm can condense to occupy a smaller area, can occupy other creatures' spaces, and can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny moth (although passing through any opening smaller than 5 ft. in any dimension is considered difficult terrain). The swarm can't regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.

***Razorswarm.*** When a creature starts its turn inside the swarm, it suffers 1d4+2 slashing damage.

***Night Terror.*** While in darkness, the swarm gains advantage on Stealth (Dexterity) checks. Additionally, the area occupied by the swarm is considered heavily obscured while it has more than half its hit points remaining. Otherwise, it is lightly obscured.

***Shapes in the Dark.*** When the swarm damages a creature that cannot see, either due to the area being dark, heavily obscured, or if the creature is suffering the blindness condition, that creature takes 1d4 psychic damage. 

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The swarm makes one Slicing Wings attack for every 30 Hit Points it has (rounded up), each against a different target within its area. It also uses its Mesmerizing Wings if available.

***Mesmerizing Wings. [Recharge 5-6]*** One creature within the swarm must make a DC 14 Charisma Saving Throw. On a failure, the first time it makes an attack roll before the swarm's next turn, the damage is also applied to one of its allies within the swarm.

***Slicing Wings.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, one target within the swarm's area. *Hit* 5 (1d6 + 2) 

### Bonus Actions
***Smothering Gloom.*** The swarm extinguishes each source of light inside it, except for open flames or light sources created with a spell slot of third level or higher.

### Reactions
***Fight the Light.*** When a creature within the swarm's area creates a light source on its space, the swarm may make a Slicing Wings attack against that creature.
