### Traits

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Epizon fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

***Titan's Wrath (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** If Epizon would be reduced to 0 hit points, his current hit point total instead resets to 400, his breath weapon recharges, and he regains any expended uses of Legendary Resistance. If he chooses, he may immediately *plane shift* to a random location in The Dream, requiring no spell components. 

Additionally, he can now use the options in the “Mythic Actions” section for 1 hour. Award a party an additional 75,000 XP (150,000 XP total) for defeating Epizon after his Titan's Wrath activates.

***Child of Two Peoples.*** Epizon can be affected by any ability or attack that targets Giants or Dragons.

***Enduring Nature.*** Epizon doesn’t need to eat, drink, or breathe, and is immune to disease. He does not age, and is unaffected by magic that changes age.

***Natural Spellcaster.*** Epizon can cast any level 1–8 spell. When he uses this feature to cast a spell, the casting time becomes 1 minute and it is cast as if using a level 9 spell slot.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** Epizon makes three attacks: two with his greatsword and one with his tail.

***Greatsword.*** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +17 to hit, reach 15 ft. _Hit:_ 23 (4d6 + 9) Force damage plus 21 (6d6) Lightning damage. If the target is a flammable object that is not being held or worn, it catches fire.

***Tail.*** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +17 to hit, reach 15 ft. _Hit:_ 25 (3d10 + 9) Bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 24 Constitution saving throw or be Stunned until the end of its next turn.

***Lightning Breath (Recharge 5–6).*** _Dexterity Saving Throw:_ DC 24, a 120–foot line that is 10 feet wide.  Flammable objects in this path that are not being held or worn catch fire. _Failure:_ 93 (17d10) Lightning damage. _Success:_ Half damage.

***Spellcasting.*** Epizon casts one of the following spells at 9th-level, requiring no spell components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 24, +16 to hit with spell attack):

1/day each: *Control Weather* (cast as 1 action), *Dispel Magic*, *Dream*, *Plane Shift*, *Reverse Gravity*

### Bonus Actions
***Change Shape.*** Epizon magically transforms himself. He can shrink himself to be any size except Tiny, or he can transform into any creature that is Medium or Small. In either case, he retains his game statistics (other than his size). This transformation ends if Epizon is reduced to 0 hit points or uses a bonus action to end it.

While Epizon is Huge or Large, the reach on his melee attacks is 10 ft; while he is Medium or Small, the reach on his melee attacks is 5 ft.

### Legendary Actions
Epizon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. Epizon regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

***Tail Attack.*** Epizon makes a tail attack.

***Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).*** _Dexterity Saving Throw:_ DC 24, each creature within 30 feet of Epizon. _Failure:_ 16 (2d6+9) Bludgeoning damage and is knocked Prone. _Also:_ Epizon can then fly up to half his flying speed.

### Mythic Actions
If Epizon's Titan's Wrath trait has activated in the last hour, he can use the options below as legendary actions.

***Call Storm (Costs 3 Actions; 1/Day).*** A storm cloud expands outward from Epizon in a sphere with a 100-foot radius, spreading around corners and darkening the battlefield. Within this radius, bright light becomes dim light, and dim light becomes darkness.  The storm lasts for one hour and does not move with Epizon. Epizon can use either Storm Strike or Thunderous Stride immediately after using Call Storm.

***Storm Strike.*** When Call Storm is active, Epizon calls down a bolt of lightning to a point he can see within the storm. <br />
_Dexterity Saving Throw:_ DC 24, each creature within 10 feet of that point. _Failure:_ 16 (3d10) Lightning damage. _Success:_ Half damage.

***Thunderous Stride.*** When Call Storm is active, Epizon teleports himself to an unoccupied space he can see within the storm. <br />
_Constitution Saving Throw:_ DC 24, each creature within 10 feet of the space he left. _Failure:_ 27 (5d10) Thunder damage. _Success:_ Half damage.
