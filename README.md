# Project Kraken

## THIS IS PLAYTEST CONTENT

This repository is where we are organizing stat blocks and magic items for our upcoming 5e campaign setting, Caerra, under the working name “Project Kraken.”

Everything is under development. Pieces may be unfinished and subject to change. Some things have not been decided. If you see something marked in {{double curly brackets}}, it is a placeholder. We’re open to suggestions for what to call it!

**Using this document:** We don’t have a collection form or a formal feedback system in place. If you are so inclined, please take notes on this document in whatever manner works best for you, and send them to us. We are open to any and all feedback. (This is a lot of content. If you don’t have time to finish reading it, we’ll take whatever you can get. Something this week is better than nothing until next month!) If you have the ability to playtest this in a real game, that would be awesome! Join our Discord server at this link: https://discord.gg/vkFBGnmVNJ
