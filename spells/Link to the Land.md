## Link to the Land
_2nd-level divination_

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of dirt from the ground you stand upon)  
**Duration:** 1 hour (concentration)

You form a mental and spiritual connection the land around you. When you cast this spell, you suffer no speed penalty on difficult terrain (unless it is due to an active spell or magical effect), and also select one of the following effects:

- **Pathfinding.** You intuitively know the quickest path to get to any destination within a mile of your current location.
- **Terrain Knowledge.** You gain a sense of the geography around you. With perfect accuracy, you know the location of each hill, river, path, tree, cave, and other natural feature within one mile of your current location.
- **Mystic Insight.** You can sense certain magic in the mile around you. You can detect the location of supernatural landmarks, such as spiritually charged monuments, places where the walls between worlds are thin, or places which are haunted. The quality of information learned when using the spell in this fashion can vary widely, and is determined by the GM.

When the spell ends, you forget the specific information gained, although you remember generalities (e.g., you recall that there is a waterfall in the vicinity, but don't know where it is.)

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can activate one additional effect for each level beyond 2nd.
