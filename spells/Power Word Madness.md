## Power Word Madness
_8th-level enchantment_

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You speak a word of power that can overwhelm the mind of one creature you can see within range, leaving it insane. If the target has 100 hit points or fewer, it is becomes insane. Otherwise, the spell has no effect. A target is also unaffected if it is immune to being charmed.

The GM rolls on the madness tables in Chapter 8 of the DMG to resolve this spells effects. Roll on the Short-Term Madness table to determine the effect of the insanity. After 1d10 minutes have passed, the target must make a Constitution Saving throw. On a successful save, this madness ends. On a failure, the target suffers lasting psychic trauma: roll on the Long-Term Madness table to determine its effect.

**At Higher Levels.** When cast at 9th level, this spell affects targets with 150 hit points or fewer. After 1d10 minutes, if they fail their saving throw to end the insanity, roll on the Indefinite Madness table instead of Long-Term.
