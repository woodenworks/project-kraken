## Boulder Toss
_2st-level conjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 20 feet  
**Components:** S, M (a pebble)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You summon a boulder and hurl it at a creature you can see within range. Make a spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 3d10 bludgeoning damage and must make a dexterity saving throw. If the target fails its saving throw, it is knocked prone and restrained by the boulder; the target has three-quarters cover while restrained. As a Utilize action, a creature can make a Strength (Athletics) check versus your spell save DC to attempt to move the boulder and mads this check with advantage if using tools or leverage; on a success, the restrained creature is freed.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The range extends by 5 feet, and the damage increases by 1d6 for every spell slot level above 2.
