## Boulder Toss
_2st-level evocation

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 20 feet  
**Components:** S, M (a pebble)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You summon a boulder and hurl it at a creature you can see within range. Make a spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 3d10 bludgeoning damage and must make a dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the target is knocked prone and restrained by the boulder; the target has three-quarters cover while restrained. A creature can use an action to attempt a Strength (Athletics) check versus your spell save DC to move the boulder, and makes that check with advantage if using leverage or tools.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The range extends by 5 feet, and the damage increases by 1d6 for every spell slot level above 2.
