## Skillful Wielder
_Level 1 Enchantment (Bard, Cleric, Wizard)_

**Casting Time:** Bonus Action  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S, M (a weapon that is worth 1+ CP)  
**Duration:** 1 hour

Your mind and body alter, becoming a you that you might have been. You gain proficiency with the weapon used in casting the spell, and you can use its mastery property. This weapon becomes eligible to use with any feature that is restricted to certain types of weapons (such as a Monk's Martial Arts ability or a Rogue's Sneak Attack). These benefits only apply to the specific weapon you used and not other weapons of that type.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The duration increases by 1 hour for each spell slot level above 1. If you use a level 5+ spell slot, the duration becomes 8 hours and you can instantly Attune to the weapon, if it requires Attunement and you are not already Attuned to the maximum number of items; if you do not meet the prerequisites for this Attunement, it ends when the spell does, unless the item is cursed.
