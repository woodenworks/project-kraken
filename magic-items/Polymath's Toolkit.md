## Polymath's Toolkit

_Wondrous item, uncommon_

This leather case has dozens of ingeniously organized pockets full of every sort of tool imaginable. This toolkit can be used in place of any artisan's tools.

Although it isn't obviously magical, there's just no way all these tools could fit in such a small case. It only weighs 8 pounds!
