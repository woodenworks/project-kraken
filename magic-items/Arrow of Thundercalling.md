## Arrow of Thundercalling
*Wondrous item, rare*

This arrow has a lightweight metal shaft, with a jagged arrowhead which hums and crackles faintly.

When you hit a target with this arrow, if the target is under open sky at the end of its next turn it will be struck by a bolt of lightning, and must make a constitution saving throw. On a failure, it suffers 8d6 lightning damage and becomes stunned until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and is not stunned.

If the target is not under open sky, the lightning is not called. Once an Arrow of Thundercalling has summoned lightning, it is destroyed.
