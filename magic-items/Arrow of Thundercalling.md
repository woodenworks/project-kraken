## Arrow of Thundercalling
*(Wondrous item, rare)*

This arrow has a lightweight metal shaft, with a jagged arrowhead which hums and crackles faintly.

When you hit a target with this arrow, if the target is under open sky at the end of its next turn it will be struck by a bolt of lightning, and must make a constitution saving throw. It suffers 8d6 lightning damage and becomes stunned on a failed save, or half damage on a successful one.

If the target is not under open sky, the lightning is not called. Once an Arrow of Thundercalling has summoned lightning, it is destroyed.
