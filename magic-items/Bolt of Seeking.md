## Bolt of Seeking
*Weapon (arrow), rare (aethertech)*

This crossbow bolt locks onto its target, vastly increasing its accuracy. You have a +10 bonus to attack rolls made with this piece of magic ammunition. Additionally, when you make an attack roll using this bolt, you can score a Critical Hit on a roll of 15â€“20 on the d20.

Once a _bolt of seeking_ deals damage to a creature, it cannot be used again.

Other types of magic ammunition of this kind exist, such as _arrows of seeking_ meant for a bow, though bolts are most common.

_The Gnomish military keeps many of these on hand, but most private individuals lack the funds to stock up on them. Crafting one bolt takes a master aethertechnician a full month._
