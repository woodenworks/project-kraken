## Ath'anwe Scout's Earring
*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*

A plain stud fashioned from bone, clearly meant to avoid drawing attention.

While wearing this earring, you gain immunity to the deafened condition, and advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing. You can identify any sound, provided you have heard it before.
