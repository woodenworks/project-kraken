## Ath'anwe Scout's Earring
*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*

A plain stud fashioned from bone, small enough to avoid drawing attention.

While wearing this earring, you gain immunity to the deafened condition, and advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing. If you hear a voice, you recognize the identity of the speaker, provided you have heard them speak before and they are not disguising their voice.
