## Circlet of Split Focus
*(Wondrous item, very rare) requires attunement*

This ornate silver circlet bears a gemstone which rests against its wearer's forehead. The gemstone is clear while unattuned, but takes on the color of its attuned user's eyes and glows while its effect is active.

While wearing this circlet, you may use an action or bonus action to transfer an effect you are concentrating on to the gemstone, allowing you to begin a second concentration effect. You make concentration checks as normal, and if you fail then you lose concentration on both effects. After using this effect, you may not use it again until you have completed a short or long rest.
