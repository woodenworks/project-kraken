## Ring of Affability

_Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunment)_

This hammered copper band glows warmly in the sunlight, although that may just be a trick of the eye.

This magical ring has 1 charge. It regains this charge when its attuned wearer completes a short or long rest. While worn, its user may use this charge to gain advantage on a Charisma (Persuasion) check made to influence a creature who is not hostile. Moreover, while this charge is unspent, other creatures are more positively disposed to the wearer. This effect will not turn enemies into friends, but otherwise indifferent creatures may be willing to help the user without requiring a Charisma check, provided that this help requires no particular risk, effort, or cost.

**Curse.** Once you attune this cursed ring, you cannot break your attunement unless you are targeted by a _remove curse_ spell or similar magic. While attuned to it, you are cursed to affably comply with requests. When you are asked or instructed to do something, you must verbally agree to the request, then make every reasonable effort to complete it immediately. This effect will not activate if the request involves violence; for instance, you cannot be ordered to harm yourself or your allies.

Furthermore, you are unaware of this magical compulsion, unless the requested action is exceptionally out of character for you (such as if it violates your Ideal or Bond). Once you have been compelled in such a way, this effect will not activate again until you have finished a short or long rest.
