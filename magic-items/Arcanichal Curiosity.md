## Arcanichal Curiosity
*(Wondrous item, rare)*

This strange little spherical device seems to be made of metal, with thin lines of magical light running along it. Faint whirs and clicks are audible from within. Upon closer inspection, there are many small buttons and switches concealed upon the surface.

As a bonus action, you may activate the device. The effect is randomly determined by rolling 1d6 and consulting the Arcanichal Curiosity table.

| 1 | The device glows with a soft purple glow, emitting dim light in a radius of 15ft. for 1 hour. | You may increase the light to bright in a 15ft. radius and dim for 15ft. beyond that, or turn it off and on for the duration |
| 2 | The device emits a soothing music box melody for 1 hour. | You may control the volume, or turn the song off and on for the duration. |
| 3 | The device reconfigures into a humanoid shape and wanders around on its own. As a bonus action on each of your turns, you may make a DC 16 Persuasion(Charisma) check to give it an order. While in this form, it uses the {{to be created gnomish tiny construct}} stat block. | The construct takes orders readily, no longer requiring a check. | 
| 4 |   |
| 5 |   |
| 6 |   |

Once per day, you may attempt a DC 25 Intelligence(Arcana) check to discern how to correctly operate the device. On a success, you may select which effect occurs whenever you activate the device from then on, and gain the secondary effect from the table.
