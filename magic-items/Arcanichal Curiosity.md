## Arcanichal Curiosity
*Wondrous item, rare*

This strange little spherical device seems to be made of metal, with thin lines of magical light running along it. Faint whirs and clicks are audible from within. Upon closer inspection, there are many small buttons and switches concealed within the surface.

As a bonus action, you may activate the device. The effect is randomly determined by rolling 1d6 and consulting the Arcanichal Curiosity table.

| 1d6| Description |
| --- | ------ |
| 1 | The device glows with a soft purple glow, emitting dim light in a radius of 15ft. for 1 hour. | You may increase the light to bright in a 15ft. radius and dim for 15ft. beyond that, or turn it off and on for the duration |
| 2 | The device emits a soothing music box melody for 1 hour. | You may control the volume, or turn the song off and on for the duration. |
| 3 | The device reconfigures into a humanoid shape and wanders around on its own. As a bonus action on each of your turns, you may make a DC 16 Persuasion(Charisma) check to give it an order. While in this form, it uses the {{to be created gnomish tiny construct}} stat block. | The construct takes orders readily, no longer requiring a check. It maintains this form for 1 hour | 
| 4 | The device becomes magically fixed in place. Until you or another creature uses an action to deactivate it, the device doesn't move, even if it is defying gravity. The device can hold up to 400 pounds of weight. More weight causes the device to deactivate and fall. A creature can use an action to make a DC 20 Strength check, moving the fixed device up to 10 feet on a success. |
| 5 | The device reconfigures into a bracelet, necklace, or other accessory. While worn it appears mundane in nature, even to a creature with detect magic or a similar effect, unless an observer succeeds on a DC 18 Arcana(Intelligence) or Investigation(Intelligence) check. It remains in this form until the wearer deactivates it as a bonus action, or it has not been worn for 1 hour. |
| 6 | The sphere begins rolling toward the nearest magic within 100 ft. the source of which isn't being worn or carried. It has a rolling speed of 5 ft. and will roll up walls, obstacles, and creatures in its way as easily as it does the floor. It stops rolling while it is being held, and will become inert again after 1 hour or when deactivated as a bonus action. |

Once per day, you may attempt a DC 26 Intelligence(Arcana) check to discern how to correctly operate the device. On a success, you may select which effect occurs whenever you activate the device from then on, and gain the secondary effect from the table.
