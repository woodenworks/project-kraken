## Gloves of the Cat
*(Wondrous item, uncommon) requires attunement*

These black leather gloves fit perfectly, conforming to your hands. When activated, silvery claws manifest from the fingers.

While wearing these gloves, you may use a bonus action to activate them. For one minute, you gain a climbing speed equal to twice your walking speed, and your unarmed attacks may use your dexterity modifier instead of strength and deal an extra 1d6 slashing damage. After using this feature, you may not use it again until you complete a short or long rest.
