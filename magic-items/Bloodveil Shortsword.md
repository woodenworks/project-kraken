## Bloodveil Shortsword
*Weapon (shortsword), rare*

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon. When you hit a creature with this shortsword, you can mentally command the sword to absorb the creature's blood and read its unique bloodprint (no action required). The blade retains the essence of the creature until you use this ability to absorb a new creature's essence, or until you hit it with the **Bloodguard Scabbard**.

When you use this sword to attack a creature who's bloodprint is stored, you gain an additional +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls. Moreover, when you cast a spell that uses blood as a material component or to aid in casting the spell (such as _bane_ or _scrying_) you can use this sword to fulfill that requirement. When used in this way, it counts as fresh blood from the creature whose essence is currently stored.

Constructs, skeletons, and other creatures without blood are immune to this effect.

This item is paired with a **Bloodguard Scabbard**, although there is a 10% chance that they have become separated.
