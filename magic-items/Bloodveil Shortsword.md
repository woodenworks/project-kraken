## Bloodveil Shortsword
*Weapon (shortsword), rare*

When you hit a creature with this +1 shortsword, you can mentally command the sword to absord the blood and read the creature's unique bloodprint (no action required). The blade retains the essence of the creature until the end of your next turn, or until you hit it with the **Bloodguard Scabbard**. When you use this sword to attack a creature who's bloodprint is stored, you have an additional +1 to attack and damage rolls.

Constructs, skeletons, and other creatures without blood are immune to this effect.

This item is paired with a **Bloodguard Scabbard**, although there is a 10% chance that they have become separated.
