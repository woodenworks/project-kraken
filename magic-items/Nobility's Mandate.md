## Nobility's Mandate
*Wondrous item, uncommon*

Once per day, this ring can be used to cast _mage armor_ without requiring material components or expending a spell slot. If the wielder takes damage while _mage armor_ is active, there is a 50% chance that the ring will require an additional day to recharge.

_As the old Illourian saying goes, “Nobles will say they’re protected by mandate, as they hide behind their soldiers.” This ring is commonly used among nobles, politicians, and high-level criminals._
