## Orb of Recall
*Wondrous item, rare*

Each hemisphere of this glass orb swirls with red or blue mist. When the location is set, the mists swirl together and become green.

This orb allows its user to travel to a predetermined sanctuary, similar to the _word of recall_ spell. As an action, a creature can smash the orb on the ground. This releases a smoke envelops the user and teleports them to the previously designated sanctuary.

You must first designate the sanctuary using an action to twist the hemispheres of the sphere. This sets the recall coordinates to your current location. Once set in this way, the destination cannot be changed. 

If you attempt to travel with the orb before designating a sanctuary, the item does not work but breaks anyway. Moreover, if broken without a designated destination, there is a 10% that you and all creatures within 10 feet of you are transported into the Dream, to a location determined by the GM.
