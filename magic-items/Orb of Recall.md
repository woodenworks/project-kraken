## Orb of Recall
*Wondrous item, rare*

Each hemisphere of this glass orb swirls with red or blue mist. When the location is set, the mists swirl together and become green.

This orb allows its user to travel to a predetermined sanctuary, similar to the _word of recall_ spell. To set your current location as its destination, use your action to twist the hemispheres of the orb. Once set, the location cannot be changed.

As an action, you can smash the orb on the ground. This releases a smoke that envelops the you and teleports you to the previously designated sanctuary.

Alternatively, as an action you can throw the orb at a creature within 40 feet of you, teleporting the target instead of you. A creature may attempt a DC 5 Dexterity saving throw to avoid the effect.

If you attempt to travel with the orb before designating a sanctuary, there is no effect and the item breaks.
