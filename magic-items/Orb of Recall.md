## Orb of Recall
*Wondrous item, rare*

Each hemisphere of this glass orb swirls with red or blue mist. When the location is set, the mists swirl together and become green.

This orb allows its user to travel to a predetermined destination. To set your current location as its destination, use your action to twist the hemispheres of the orb. Once set, the location cannot be changed.

As an action, you can smash the orb on the ground. This releases a smoke that envelops you and teleports you to the previously designated destination. You appear in the nearest unoccupied space to the spot you designated when you prepared your destination.

Alternatively, as an action you can throw the orb at a creature within 40 feet of you, teleporting the target instead of you. A creature can attempt a DC 5 Dexterity saving throw, avoiding the effect on a success.

If you attempt to travel with the orb before designating a destination, there is no effect and the item breaks.
