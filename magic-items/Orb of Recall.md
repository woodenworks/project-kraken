## Orb of Recall
*Wondrous item, rare*

Each hemisphere of this glass orb swirls with red or blue mist. When the location is set, the mists swirl together and become green.

This orb allows its user to travel to a predetermined sanctuary, similar to the _word of recall_ spell. As an action, you twist the hemispheres of the orb to store your current location as its destination. Once set, the location cannot be changed.

As an action, you can smash the orb on the ground. This releases a smoke that envelops the you and teleports you to the previously designated sanctuary.

If you use your action you may throw the orb at a creature within 40 feet. The creature may attempt a DC 5 Dexterity saving throw to avoid the smoke. If it fails or chooses not to attempt to save against the effect, it is teleported instead.

If you attempt to travel with the orb before designating a sanctuary, the item does not work but breaks anyway.
