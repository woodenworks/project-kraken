## Arcanichal Curiosity
*(Wondrous item, rare)*

This strange little spherical device seems to be made of metal, with thin lines of magical light running along it. Faint whirs and clicks are audible from within. Upon closer inspection, there are many small buttons and switches concealed upon the surface.

As a bonus action, you may activate the device. The effect is randomly determined by rolling 1d6 and consulting the Arcanichal Curiosity table.

| 1 | The device glows with a soft purple glow, emitting dim light in a radius of 15ft. |
| 2 |   |
| 3 |   |
| 4 |   |
| 5 |   |
| 6 |   |

Once per day, a creature may attempt a DC 23 Arcana(Intelligence) check to discern how to correctly operate the device. On a success, that creature may select which effect occurs whenever they activate the device from then on.
