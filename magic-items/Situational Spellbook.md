## Situational Spellbook
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a wizard)*

This spellbook is bound in rich brown leather, decorated with arcane sigils. There is a hand-shaped outline embossed on the cover. When found, it contains the following spells, which are wizard spells for you while you are attuned to the book: _alarm, arcane lock, comprehend languages, disguise self, expeditious retreat, fabricate, find traps, identify,_ and _tiny hut_.

When you prepare your spells during a long rest, you may ready a secondary slate of prepared spells. As an action, you may place your hand on the book's cover and speak its command word; doing this replaces your currently prepared spells with the secondary slate you prepared.

(I don't know how I feel about "slate." Actually, I love it, but I don't know if it's the best word. Also maybe it's a bonus action? Maybe there's charges? Can they toggle between slates? Definitely need to remove some spells from the list.)
