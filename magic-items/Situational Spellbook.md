## Situational Spellbook
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a wizard)*

This spellbook is bound in rich brown leather and decorated with arcane sigils. There is a hand-shaped outline embossed on the cover. When found, it contains the following spells, which are wizard spells for you while you are attuned to the book: _alarm, arcane lock, comprehend languages, fabricate, find traps,_ and _identify._

When you prepare your spells during a long rest, you may also prepare a second list of spells. A spell may be on both lists. (Consult the  “Preparing and Casting Spells” section of your class guidelines for details on how to prepare spells.) If you spend a minute meditating with your hand on the book's cover, you replace your currently prepared spells with the secondary list you prepared. You do not regain any expended spell slots.
