## Situational Spellbook
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a wizard)*

This spellbook is bound in rich brown leather and decorated with arcane sigils. There is a hand-shaped outline embossed on the cover. When found, it contains the following spells, which are wizard spells for you while you are attuned to the book: _alarm, arcane lock, comprehend languages, disguise self, expeditious retreat, fabricate, find traps, identify,_ and _tiny hut_.

When you prepare your spells during a long rest, you may also prepare a second list of prepared spells. A spell may be prepared on both lists. (Consult the  “Preparing and Casting Spells” section of your class guidelines for details on how to prepare spells.) If you spend a minute meditating with your hand on the book's cover, you replace your currently prepared spells with the secondary list you prepared. You do not regain any expended spell slots.

(I don't know how I feel about "slate." Actually, I love it, but I don't know if it's the best word. Also maybe it's a bonus action? Maybe there's charges? Can they toggle between slates? Definitely need to remove some spells from the list.)
