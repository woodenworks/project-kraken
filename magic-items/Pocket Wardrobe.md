## Pocket Wardrobe
*Wondrous item, rarity varies*

A sophisticated adventurer should not need to sacrifice style to stay alive! This item appears to be a pocket watch, but is enchanted to allow its wearer to quickly change outfits. As a Bonus Action, you can press the crown; at the start of your next turn, your current outfit is swapped with a stored outfit. Using an Action or Reaction before this takes effect cancels the process.

This item can store a number of different outfits based on its rarity (see the table below), and you can select which outfit to access by twisting the crown as part of your Bonus Action to use the item. This item can store clothing, armor, jewelry, and stowed weapons, such as sheathed blades or quivers. It cannot store held weapons, unattuned magic items that require attunment, or items that cannot reasonably be deemed part of an outfit. Saving an outfit into an empty slot will leave you nude, so discretion is recommended.

Placing a _Pocket Wardrobe_ inside an extradimensional space created by a _Bag of Holding_, _Portable Hole_, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within a 10-foot-radius Sphere centered on the gate is sucked through it to a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way and can’t be reopened.

| Legendary | 30           | Any nonmagical clothing summoned from the wardrobe grants you a base AC of 13 plus your Dexterity modifier. This effect applies to only one outfit at a time, and lasts for 24 hours after being withdrawn from the wardrobe.|
