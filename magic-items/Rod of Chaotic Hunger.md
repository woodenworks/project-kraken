## Rod of Chaotic Hunger

_Rod, very rare (requires attunement by a Warlock)_

This skinny metal rod appears to be a tentacle covered in eyeballs. When you cast _Eldritch Blast_ while holding this rod, roll 2d6. In addition to the normal results of your _Eldritch Blast_:
- If one of the d6’s lands on a 1, you take an amount of Psychic damage equal to the result of the 2d6 roll.
- If _both_ d6’s land on 1, you immediately cast _Circle of Death_, centered on yourself, without requiring material components or expending a spell slot. You have Resistance to its damage, unless you already have Immunity from another source.
- If both d6’s land on 6, you regain one expended Pact Magic spell slot.
- Otherwise, each creature targeted by your _Eldritch Blast_ takes an amount of Psychic damage equal to the result of the 2d6 roll.
