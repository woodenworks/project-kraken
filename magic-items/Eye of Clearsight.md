## Circlet of Split Focus
*(Wondrous item, very rare) requires attunement*

A tourmaline set into an oblong topaz forms the shape of an eye on this pendant, which hangs from a silver chain.

While wearing this pendant, you gain darkvision out to a range of 120ft. In addition, you gain the ability to see in magical darkness and your vision is unimpeded by fog or other cloud effects. As an action, you may pierce all visual illusions you can see, instantly succeeding on any check required to see the illusions for what they are.

***Curse***
While attuned to this item, the bearer resists any attempt to be parted from it. After 1d4+3 days they must make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw each time they long rest. On a failed save, they do not gain the benefits of the long rest. When this happens, they may choose to treat the failed long rest as a short rest, and gain all the benefits of a short rest instead. {{Antagonist}} may use an action to see through the wearer's eyes, gaining access to their sight but no other senses. This effect lasts until {{Antagonist}} ends it as a bonus action.
