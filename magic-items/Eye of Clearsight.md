## Eye of Clearsight
*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)*

A tourmaline set into an oblong topaz forms the shape of an eye on this pendant, which hangs from a silver chain.

While wearing this pendant, you gain truesight out to a range of 120ft. In addition, you gain immunity to the Blinded condition and advantage on perception checks that rely on sight.

***Curse***
While attuned to this item, the bearer resists any attempt to be parted from it. After 1d4+3 days they must make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw each time they long rest. On a failed save, they do not gain the benefits of the long rest. When this happens, they may choose to treat the failed long rest as a short rest, and gain all the benefits of a short rest instead. 

***Additional Curse***
This pendant is linked to a _Mirror of Clearsight_. When the bearer of this mirror uses an action and speaks the activation word, the mirror's surface changes to display whatever the pendant's wearer sees. The mirror only relays sight, including truesight or darkvision, but not sound or any other senses. This effect lasts until it is ended as a bonus action. 

This additional curse is very difficult to discern; it can only be identified with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check made while casting the _identify_ spell (although more powerful magic, such as the _legend lore_ spell may identify it, at the GM's discretion.) If the spell _purify object_ (or similar magic) is used to remove curses from this item, it only removes the first curseâ€”it must be cast a second time to remove this additional curse.
