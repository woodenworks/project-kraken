## Eye of Clearsight
*(Wondrous item, very rare) requires attunement*

A tourmaline set into an oblong topaz forms the shape of an eye on this pendant, which hangs from a silver chain.

While wearing this pendant, you gain truesight out to a range of 120ft. In addition, you gain immunity to the Blinded condition and advantage on perception checks that rely on sight.

***Curse***
While attuned to this item, the bearer resists any attempt to be parted from it. After 1d4+3 days they must make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw each time they long rest. On a failed save, they do not gain the benefits of the long rest. When this happens, they may choose to treat the failed long rest as a short rest, and gain all the benefits of a short rest instead. {{Antagonist}} may use an action to see through the wearer's eyes, gaining access to their sight but no other senses. This effect lasts until {{Antagonist}} ends it as a bonus action.
