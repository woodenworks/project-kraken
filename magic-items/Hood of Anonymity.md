## ~~Hood of Anonymity~~
*Wondrous item, rare*

The inside of this otherwise-generic hood is embroidered with silver arcane script.

While wearing this hood, you may use an action and speak its command word to become anonymous for 10 minutes. You are still visible to people around you, but you will not be recognized by passersby. If you tell somebody who you are, this illusion is broken for them.

If you have interact with somebody while this effect is active, they will view you as an innocuous stranger. They might remember the conversation afterward, but will not remember any details about you. If they think deeper about the interaction—such as if they are questioned by someone else, or if they are guarding something that ends up stolen—they may make a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw, remembering you and the interaction on a success.

Alternatively, if you are acting suspicious while anonymously interacting with somebody (such as asking a bank guard to borrow their keys or trying to gain sensitive information from a city official), that person may make a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw, ending the effect on a success.
