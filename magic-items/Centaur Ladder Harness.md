## Centaur Ladder Harness
*Wondrous item, common*

A Centaur can use this harness to travel up and down ladders, even if this involves going through a space that would otherwise be too small for the Centaur.

_Nobody is quite sure how these Gnomish inventions works, even the people who construct them. Shortly after the Rupture, as the posture of the world's powers became less hostile, this harnes was created to help Centaurs who wanted to engage with the world. Today, these harnesses are mass-produced and nearly every Centaur who lives in a city (or works as an adventurer) owns one. New workers at the factory are encouraged not to think too hard about the mechanics or implications._
