## Cloak of the People's Favor
*(Wondrous item, uncommon)*

This comfortable cloak is lined with small embroidered sigils which emit a soft white glow. Each time a charge is expended, one sigil is extinguished.

The cloak has 50 charges. While wearing the cloak, each time an attack hits you by exactly meeting your AC, expend one charge to cause the attack to miss instead. When you fail a Dexterity saving throw made in response to a damaging effect, you may use your reaction to expend 5 charges and succeed instead. When all charges are expended, the cloak loses all magical properties.
