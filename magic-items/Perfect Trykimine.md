## Perfect Trykimine
*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement by a Trykimar)*

This perfect gemstone glitters with its own internal light. The changeable nature of the light within makes trying to identify the color of the gemstone itself impossible. According to legend, these stones are the crystalized souls of powerful Trykimar.

When completing a long rest, you may choose to imbue the stone with the dominant element of the current location. While the stone is imbued, when completing a short or long rest you may choose to draw on the energy of the stone to assume that elemental form until your next long rest is completed. When drawing on the stone in this way, roll 1d4. On a 4, the stone remains imbued with the element. Otherwise, the energy is consumed and the light within the stone goes out.
