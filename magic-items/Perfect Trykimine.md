## Perfect Trykimine
*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement by a Trykimar)*

When you complete a long rest, you can imbue this gemstone with the primary element of the current location (consult the Elemental Terrain table in the Trykimar's racial description to determine which element is primary). 

While the stone is imbued, whenever you complete a Short or Long Rest you can change your Elemental Form to match the imbued element. Once you change your form in this way, roll a d4; on a 1â€“3, the gem cannot be used again until you imbue it with a new element.

_This perfect gemstone glitters with its own internal light. The changeable nature of the light within makes trying to identify the color of the gemstone itself impossible. According to legend, these stones are the crystalized souls of powerful Trykimar._
