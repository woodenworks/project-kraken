## ~~Hood of Seeming~~
*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*

This hood, designed to be worn with a cloak or robe, bears arcane embroidery in silver thread within the lining.

While the hood is on, as an action, you may gain the benefits of the Seeming spell for yourself only. Once used, this feature may not be used again until you complete a long rest.
