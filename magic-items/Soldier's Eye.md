_When the fledgeling Aradadonian Empire first invaded Arm Polavia, its Human soldiers struggled in the darkness of the Dwarven tunnels. With the magical technology available at the time, Goggles of Night were prohibitively expensive to produce at scale. The Soldier's Eye was a cheap and effective—if gruesome—way to bring darkvision to Human troops, and more advanced sight abilities to commanders and special operators. Tens of thousands of these eyes were produced over the following centuries, and are still commonly found today._
