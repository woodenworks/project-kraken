## Soldier's Eye
*Wondrous item, common*

When you place this glass eye in your empty eye socket, you have darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.

_When the fledgeling Aradadonian Empire first invaded Arm Polavia, its Human soldiers struggled in the darkness of the Dwarven tunnels. With the magical technology available at the time, Goggles of Night were prohibitively expensive to produce at scale. The Soldier's Eye was a cheap and effective—if gruesome—way to bring darkvision to Human troops. Tens of thousands of these eyes were produced over the following centuries, and are still commonly found today._
