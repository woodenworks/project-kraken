## Elemental Hand Wraps
*Wondrous item (hand wraps), rare*

These wraps shimmer, as if woven with metallic thread. While using these hand wraps, you can decide what type of damage your Unarmed Strikes deal: Bludgeoning, Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, Poison, or Thunder. When you make your attack roll, declare which type of damage it will deal.
