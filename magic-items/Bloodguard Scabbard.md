## Bloodguard Scabbard
*Wondrous item (scabbard), rare (requires attunement)*

In the hands of a Monk, this scabbard is a club that counts as a Monk Weapon; for everyone else, this can be used as an improvised weapon. 

This scabbard has 2 charges. When you use this item to hit a creature whose essence is stored in the **Bloodveil shortsword**, you can expend a charge to ignite its blood. The target takes 2d6 fire damage, and an additional 3d6 fire damage if it is an Undead creature that has blood (such as a vampire or zombie). The scabbard regains 1d2 charges daily at dawn.

This item is paired with a **Bloodveil Shortsword**, although there is a 10% chance that they have become separated.
