## Bloodguard Scabbard
*Wondrous item (scabbard), rare (requires attunement)*

In the hands of a Monk, this scabbard is a club that counts as a Monk Weapon; for everyone else, this can be used as an improvised weapon. 

This scabbard has 2 charges. When you use this item to hit a creature whose essence is stored in the **Bloodveil Shortsword**, you can expend a charge to ignite its blood. The target takes 2d6 Fire damage, and an additional 3d6 Fire damage if it is an Undead creature that has blood (such as a vampire or zombie). The scabbard regains 1d2 charges daily at dusk.

This item is paired with a **Bloodveil Shortsword**, although there is a 10% chance that they have become separated. You can perform a ritual that takes 1 hour, during which you must fill the scabbard with the blood of a Humanoid; upon completion of the ritual, you are able to find the location of the paired sword as if with the _Find the Path_ spell. This effect ends when dispelled, when you sheath the sword in the scabbard, or after 30 days.
