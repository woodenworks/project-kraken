## Flute of the Mists

_Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunment by a creature profiecient with flutes)_

This wooden flute is etched with swirling patterns along its length.

As an action, an attuned creature may begin to play the flute, causing mist to billow from the flutes holes out to a 45ft. radius around the user.
- All effects last as long as the user is concentrating on the song.
- The user and up to 2 other creatures selected by them within range are immune to its effects.
- Each turn, the user may spend a bonus action to continue the song, or an Action to change to the next verse
- For the duration of the song, all creatures within range gain disadvantage on attack rolls Wisdom(perception) checks.
- Second verse makes affected creatures unable to move out of the radius, getting turned around when they try.
- Third verse makes apparitions appear from the mist, dealing 2d4 damage every turn

When the song ends for any reason (deliberately, lost concentration, silence effect, etc.), the flute's magic goes inert until the user completes a long rest.
