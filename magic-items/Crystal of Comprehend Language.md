## Crystal of Comprehend Language
*Wondrous item, uncommon*

This crystalline rod is roughly six inches longand glowing slightly. There are lines marking it into three sections, with smaller tick marks between them. It has been imbued with the saliva of someone who speaks a specific language (determined by the GM) and has 3 charges. As an action, you can use a charge to the crystal. While this effect is active, you can speak, understand, read and write this language with no accent, as if you were a native speaker. The effect ends after three hours or if the player moves more than ten feet from the crystal.

As the duration continues, the glow recedes down the length of the crystal. A character viewing the crystal can tell how much time is left rounded to the nearest 20 minute increment. When the effect ends one section of the rod crumbles to sand. This happens even if it ends prematurely, although in this case there is also a bright flash as the remaining magical energy escapes.
