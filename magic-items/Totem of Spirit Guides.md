## Totem of Spirit Guides
*(Wondrous item, rare) requires incense, which is consumed*

This totem carved from a large horn seems to bear features from many different animals. When incense is lit within its mouth, smoke pours from its many claws, wings, and antlers.

When you burn incense within this totem and focus on a location, person, or object, you may roll 1d100. If the result is lower than your Character Level plus your Wisdom Modifier, a spirit tied to your current location manifests and will lead you for ten minutes in the direction of your target. The spirit will match your pace, and will guide you to the correct path even if you have become lost by magical means. After attempting to summon a spirit, you may not use this feature again until you have completed a long rest.
