## Totem of Spirit Guides
*Wondrous item, rare*

This totem carved from a large horn seems to bear features from many different animals. When incense is lit within its mouth, smoke pours from its many claws, wings, and antlers.

When you place incense within this totem and burn it, you can focus on a target (either a location, person, or object), and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your Character Level plus your Wisdom Modifier, a spirit will manifest and lead you for ten minutes toward the target. The spirit is linked to your current location and has an appropriate appearance decided by the GM; it is visible to any creature who inhaled the smoke from the incense. The spirit will guide you to your target, matching your pace and movement abilities and staying within your visual range.  It will guide you to the correct path even if you have become lost by magical means. After attempting to summon a spirit, this item may not be used again until the following dawn.
