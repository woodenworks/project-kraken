## Orb of Mystic Transduction
*Wondrous item, rarity varies*

Looking into this orb, it is impossible to see to the other side. The glass warps, reflects, and refracts, seemingly forever.

When a creature casts a level 1+ spell that isn't on the Wizard spell list, they can cast the spell into the orb by touching it as the spell is cast. The spell has no effect, other than to be stored in the orb. If the orb canâ€™t hold the spell, the spell is expended without effect.

Once a spell has been stored in such a way, the orb's magic translates it into arcane formulae; if you are a Wizard, you can add this spell to your spellbook as if this was a spell scroll, following the usual rules for adding new spells presented in the Wizard class description. This spell becomes a Wizard spell for you.

Once an orb is used in this way, it becomes smoky and opaque, and cannot be used again.

When you find this orb, there is a 20% chance that there is already a spell stored within (determined by the GM). The orb's rarity determines the maximum level of the spell that can be stored within it.

| Very Rare | 7                   |
| Legendary | 9                   |
