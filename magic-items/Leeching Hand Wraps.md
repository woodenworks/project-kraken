## Leeching Hand Wraps
*Wondrous item (hand wraps), uncommon*

These wraps are permanently blood-stained.

This item has 6 charges. Once per turn, when you hit with an Unarmed Strike, you may expend a charge to make it a Leeching Strike. This strike deals an additional 1d10 Necrotic damage, and you recover an equivalent amount of hit points.

The item regains 1d6 charges at dusk.

**_Curse._** If this item is worn for more than 3 hours without being used, the wielder's fists begin to itch and ache. The wielder cannot benefit from resting and has disadvantage on ability checks until either removing the wraps or dealing damage with an Unarmed Strike.
