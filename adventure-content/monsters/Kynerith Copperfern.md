### Traits

***Pale Ward.*** Kynerith is surrounded by a faint psychic veil. The first time she takes damage on a round, reduce that damage by 10 (once per round).

***Chorus of Despair (Recharge 5–6).*** Psychic static radiates from Kynerith. Each creature in a 30-foot cone must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or take 18 (4d8) psychic damage and be **frightened** until the end of their next turn. On a success, a creature takes half damage and is not frightened.
