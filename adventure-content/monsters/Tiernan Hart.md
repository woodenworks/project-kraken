### Traits

***Elemental Forms.*** As a Trykimar, Tiernan has four elemental forms which are supercharged by the elemental machines Tiernan is using. Each form provides special immunities, traits, and abilities.

***Stormy Disposition [Air Form].*** Tiernan has advantage on saving throws against spells such as gust which use air to move them. When they succeed on these saving throws, they can choose whether to allow the spell to resolve normally or for the wind to carry them twice as far as it normally would.

***Solid Footing [Earth Form].*** Tiernan has advantage on saving throws against eﬀects caused by tremors in the earth, such as from the _earthquake_ spell, and ignore difficult terrain caused by 

***Fiery Defense [Fire Form].*** Tiernan is wreathed in flames. Whenever a creature attempts a melee attack against Tiernan, that creature takes 1d10 Fire damage.

***Slick Footing [Water Form].*** Tiernan's feet are coated in ice; they have a move speed of 60 feet and ignore difficult terrain caused by ice. Additionally, they have a swim speed equal to their move speed.

### Actions

Regardless of their elemental form, Tiernan can do the following:

***Multiattack.*** Tiernan makes one Arcane Burst attack and uses the action provided by their current form.

***Arcane Burst.*** _Melee or Ranged Spell Attack:_ +9 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 120 ft. _Hit:_ 21 (3d10 + 5) Force damage.

***Electric Gust [Air Form Only].*** *Dexterity Saving Throw:* DC 20, all creatures in a line 5-ft wide and 30-ft long. *Failure:* 13 (3d8) Lightning damage and pushed 15 feet away following the line. *Success:* Half damage.

***Ground Pound [Earth Form Only].*** *Dexterity Saving Throw:* DC 20, all creatures within 30 feet of Tiernan. *Failure:* 13 (2d12) Thunder damage and are knocked prone. *Failure:* The target can't make Opportunity Attacks until the start of its next turn.

***Shocking Grasp [Fire Form Only].*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +9 to hit, reach 5ft. *Hit* 5 (3d8) lightning damage. *Effect:* The target can't make Opportunity Attacks until the start of its next turn.

***Shocking Grasp [Water Form Only].*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +9 to hit, reach 5ft. *Hit* 5 (3d8) lightning damage. *Effect:* The target can't make Opportunity Attacks until the start of its next turn.

***Spellcasting.*** Tiernan casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 20):
- At will: _detect evil and good, invisibility_ (self only)
- 3/day each: _boulder toss, scorching ray, ice knife, raise dead_
- 1/day each: _commune, control weather, insect plague_

### Bonus Actions

***Expeditious.*** Tiernan takes the Disengage action.

### Legendary Actions

Tiernan can take the *Teleport* legendary action once per round, immediately before their lair action.

***Teleport.*** Tiernan magically teleports, along with any equipment they are wearing and carrying, up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space they can see.

---

### Lair Actions
When Tiernan fights in the room presumed by this adventure, they gain the following lair action, which they can use on initiative count 20 (losing ties).

***Activate Machine.*** Tiernan activates one of their machines within 5 feet. They cannot activate the same machine twice in a row. When they activate a machine, a machine effect occurs and a mephit appears (both detailed below). Additionally, Tiernan's elemental form changes to match the new machine.

- A machine effect occurs based on which machine is activated. Tiernan is immune to the effects of these machines, although Tiernan's allies are not.

| Element | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Air     | Gale force winds erupt from the machine. All creatures in the room must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. They are pushed 20 feet away from the machine on a failure, or half as much on a success. A creature who is pushed at least 5 feet and then is stopped by a wall takes 1d6 Bludgeoning damage. While this machine is active, ranged weapon attacks are made with disadvantage. |
| Earth   | The ground in the chamber quakes. All creatures in the room must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, or fall prone. While this machine is active, the ground in the chamber is considered difficult terrain.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Fire    | The machine shoots three bolts of fire at the three nearest creatures; each targeted creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, or else take 1d10 Fire damage. While this machine is active, any effect that deals fire damage in an area, such as the _fireball_ spell, affects double the usual area.                                                                      |
| Water   | A 30-foot cone of icy spray erupts from the machine. All creatures in its path must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, or else take 1d6 Cold damage and have their movement speed reduced by half until the end of their next turn. While this machine is active, if a creature takes Lightning damage, all adjacent creatures also takes the same amount of Lightning damage.           |

- A mephit with a hit point maximum of 1 appears in the nearest unoccupied space to the machine. The mephit's type is the mixture between the previously activated element and the new one. For instance, if the water machine was previously activated, when Tiernan activates the earth machine a **mud mephit** will appear. The mephit is allied with Tiernan.

| Previous Element  | New Element | Mephit Type |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Air       | Earth     | Dust        |
| Air       | Fire      | Smoke       |
| Air       | Water     | Ice         |
| Earth     | Air       | Dust        |
| Earth     | Fire      | Magma       |
| Earth     | Water     | Mud         |
| Fire      | Air       | Smoke       |
| Fire      | Earth     | Magma       |
| Fire      | Water     | Steam       |
| Water     | Air       | Ice         |
| Water     | Earth     | Mud         |
| Water     | Fire      | Steam       |

Each machine has 30 hit points and vulnerability to Bludgeoning and Lightning damage. Attack rolls against the machines automatically succeed. However, the machines are sturdy; when they would take damage less than 10 points, they instead take no damage.
