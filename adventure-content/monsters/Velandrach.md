### Traits

***Arcane Matrix (1/day).*** If Velandrach is not targeted by an attack or forced to make a saving throw for 2 full rounds, he gains a 30-point arcane shield. This barrier grants him +2 AC and absorbs damage until depleted.

***Master of Glyphs.*** As part of his action or multiattack, Velandrach can embed a glyph of force into an unoccupied 5-foot cube within 60 feet. A glyph is triggered when a creature other than Velandrach enters its space or ends its turn there. The triggering creature must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 13 (3d10) force damage. Velandrach can maintain up to three glyphs at a time. Triggered glyphs vanish.

***Dreamsteel Flesh.*** Velandrach has resistance to Force and Psychic damage.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** Velandrach uses his _Create Glyph_ and _Eldritch Blast_ abilities.

***Create Glyph.*** Velandrach embeds a glyph into an unoccupied 5-foot cube he can see within 60 feet.

***Eldritch Blast.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +8 to hit, range 120 ft., three targets. *Hit:* 10 (1d10 + 4) Force damage per beam.

***Gravitic Collapse (Recharge 5–6).*** Velandrach creates a sphere of collapsing force. _Dexterity Saving Throw:_ Each creature in a 20-foot sphere at a point Velandrach can see within 60 feet. _Failure:_ 27 (6d8) Force damage. _Success:_ Half damage.

***Spellcasting (4/Short Rest).*** Velandrach casts one of the following spells at 5th-level, requiring no material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 18):
- *fear*, *hypnotic pattern*, *counterspell*, *wall of force*, *dimension door*

### Bonus Actions

***Tactical Warp.*** Velandrach teleports to a space he can see within 30 feet. Until the end of his next turn, he has advantage on saving throws against being grappled or restrained.

***Strategic Curse (1/short rest).*** One creature Velandrach can see has disadvantage on attack rolls against all creatures other than Velandrach until the end of its next turn.

### Reaction

***Counter-Glyph.*** When Velandrach is targeted by a spell, he may consume one of his active glyphs to cast *counterspell* as a reaction without using a spell slot.

### Legendary Actions

Velandrach can take 2 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. He regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

***Command Glyph.*** One of Velandrach’s active glyphs immediately detonates if a creature is in its space.

***Force Pulse.*** _Strength Saving Throw:_ DC 16, each creature within a 10-ft emanation. _Failure:_ Pushed 10 feet directly away from Velandrach and knocked prone. _Success:_ No effect.

***Mental Scourge (Costs 2).*** _Wisdom Saving Throw:_ One creature within 60 feet. _Failure:_ 14 (4d6) psychic damage and disadvantage on its next saving throw. _Success:_ No effect.
