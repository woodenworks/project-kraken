### Traits

***Arcane Matrix.*** If Velandrach is not targeted by an attack or forced to make a saving throw for 2 full rounds, he gains a 30-point arcane shield. This barrier grants him +2 AC and absorbs damage until depleted.

***Master of Glyphs.*** As part of his action or multiattack, Velandrach can embed a glyph of force into an unoccupied 5-foot cube within 60 feet. A glyph is triggered when a creature other than Velandrach enters its space or ends its turn there. The triggering creature must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 13 (3d10) force damage. Velandrach can maintain up to three glyphs at a time. Triggered glyphs vanish.

***Dreamsteel Flesh.*** Velandrach has resistance to force and psychic damage.

### Actions

***Eldritch Blast.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +10 to hit, range 120 ft., three beams. *Hit:* 10 (1d10 + 5) force damage per beam.

***Gravitic Collapse (Recharge 5–6).*** Velandrach creates a 20-foot radius sphere of collapsing force at a point he can see within 60 feet. Each creature in that area must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 27 (6d8) force damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

***Spellcasting.*** Velandrach is a warlock who casts spells at 5th level. His spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 18, +10 to hit). He can cast each of the following spells once per day:

- *fear*
- *hypnotic pattern*
- *counterspell*
- *wall of force*
- *dimension door*

### Bonus Actions

***Tactical Warp.*** Velandrach teleports to a space he can see within 30 feet. Until the end of his next turn, he has advantage on saving throws against being grappled or restrained.

***Strategic Curse (1/short rest).*** One creature Velandrach can see has disadvantage on attack rolls against all creatures other than Velandrach until the end of its next turn.

### Reaction

***Counter-Glyph.*** When Velandrach is targeted by a spell, he may consume one of his active glyphs to cast *counterspell* as a reaction without using a spell slot.

### Legendary Actions

Velandrach can take 2 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. He regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

***Command Glyph.*** One of Velandrach’s active glyphs immediately detonates if a creature is in its space.

***Force Pulse.*** Each creature within 10 feet must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be pushed 10 feet and knocked prone.

***Mental Scourge (Costs 2).*** One creature within 60 feet must make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or take 14 (4d6) psychic damage and have disadvantage on its next saving throw.
