### Traits

***Illusory Shroud.*** Mateo is always under the effects of *mirror image*. If he casts it again, all three duplicates are restored, regardless of how many remain.

***Grand Deceiver.*** Ranged attacks against Mateo are made with disadvantage while at least one of his duplicates from *mirror image* remains.

***Contingent Lies.*** The first time each round that Mateo fails a saving throw, he instead succeeds. This effect recharges at the end of his next turn.

***Fractured Presence.*** At the start of combat, Mateo creates a spectral echo of himself. On Initiative 10, the echo repeats his last action, targeting the same location or creature. The echo disappears if it takes damage or is the target of *dispel magic*.

***Everyone’s Watching.*** Mateo targets a creature within 60 feet.

- *mirror image*, *counterspell*, *major image*, *synaptic static*, *dominate person*

### Bonus Actions

***Incorporeal.*** The soldier occupies space but cannot block movement or be grappled. It hovers 5 feet above the ground and makes no sound.

***Death Throes.*** When the soldier reaches 0 Hit Points, it detonates in a surge of psychic force. - *Dexterity Saving Throw:* DC 16, all creatures within 10 feet of the soldier. **Failure:** 14 (4d6) Force damage. **Success:** Half damage.

### Behavior
