### Traits

***Contingent Lies.*** The first time each round that Mateo fails a saving throw, he instead succeeds. This effect recharges at the end of his next turn.

***Fractured Presence.*** At the start of combat, Mateo creates a spectral echo of himself. On Initiative 10, the echo repeats his last action, targeting the same location or creature. The echo disappears if it takes damage or is the target of *dispel magic*.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** Mateo uses *Everyone’s Watching* and makes an *Eldritch Blast* attack.

***Eldritch Blast.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +10 to hit, range 120 ft., three targets. *Hit:* 12 (1d10 + 6) Force damage per beam.

***Everyone’s Watching.*** _Wisdom Saving Throw:_ DC 16, one creature within 60 feet that Mateo can see. *Failure:* The creature is convinced it’s being observed and judged. It has disadvantage on attack rolls until the end of its next turn and cannot take reactions. *Success:* No effect.

***Command Illusion.*** Mateo moves one of his illusions up to 20 feet and detonates it if it enters a creature’s space.

***Spellcasting (4/Short Rest).*** Mateo casts one of the following spells at 5th-level, requiring no material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 18):  
- *mirror image*, *counterspell*, *major image*, *synaptic static*, *dominate person*

### Bonus Actions

***Tactical Swap.*** Mateo switches places with one of his illusions that he can see (including spectral echo, illusory duplicates, or Phantasmal Soldiers).

***Compelling Presence.*** _Charisma Saving Throw:_ DC 18, one creature Mateo can see within 30 feet. *Failure:* The creature is charmed until the end of Mateo’s next turn. *Success:* The creature is immune to this ability for 24 hours.

### Legendary Actions

Mateo can take 1 legendary action, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. He regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn. When he uses either of the following options, he can also use his **Tactical Swap** ability.

***Illusory Army.*** Mateo summons three **Phantasmal Soldiers** to points he can see within 30 feet.

***Stagebound Reflections.*** Mateo summons three illusionary duplicates in unoccupied spaces he can see within 60 feet. 
- Each duplicate is indistinguishable from Mateo
- On Mateo's turn, each duplicate can move up to 30 feet
- Each duplicate has **AC 14** and **1 hit point**
– Duplicates vanish if they are dispelled, destroyed, or when Mateo uses this trait again or dies
