### Traits

***Illusory Shroud.*** Mateo is always under the effects of *mirror image*. If he casts it again, all three duplicates are restored, regardless of how many remain.

***Grand Deceiver.*** Ranged attacks against Mateo are made with disadvantage while at least one of his duplicates from *mirror image* remains.

***Contingent Lies.*** The first time each round that Mateo fails a saving throw, he instead succeeds. This effect recharges at the end of his next turn.

***Fractured Presence.*** At the start of combat, Mateo creates a spectral echo of himself. On Initiative 10, the echo repeats his last action, targeting the same location or creature. The echo disappears if it takes damage or is the target of *dispel magic*.
